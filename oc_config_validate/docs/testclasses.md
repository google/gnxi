### Module telemetry_once

Uses gNMI Subscribe messages, of type ONCE.

Optionally, every Update messages can have its timestamp value checked
  against the local time when the Subscription message was sent. The absolute
  time drift is compared against a max value in secs.

Optionally, the number of expected Notifications (equals to the amount of)
  timestamps) is checked.

> If the arguments are not present in the test, the check is not performed.

Args:
  *  *notifications_count*: Number of expected Notification messages.
  *  *max_timestamp_drift_secs*: Maximum drift for the timestamp(s).


####  `telemetry_once.CountUpdatesCheckType`

In addition to the default checks of the module, this test checks that the
returned Updates and their values type, without checking any OC  model. This
is a rather basic test that relies on knowing exactly the expected replies to
the Subscription.

All Update values are expected to be of the same Type, as 'string_val',
  'int_val', etc.

Args:
 *  **xpaths**: List of gNMI paths to subscribe to. Paths can contain
     wildcard '*'.
 *  **updates_count**: Number of expected Update messages.
 *  **values_type**: Python type of the values of the Updates.


####  `telemetry_once.CheckStateLeafs`

In addition to the default checks of the module, this test checks that the
subscription to */state* containers updates all leafs.

This test subscribes only xpaths of */state* containers. It renders the
  corresponding OC model and lists all paths to the downstream Leafs. The
  Update paths received in the Subscription reply are checked against the
  Leafs of the Model (Update paths must match an OC Model Leaf).

Optionally, use `check_missing_model_paths` to assert that all OC model paths
  are present in the Updates. Usually, the Subscription replies might not
  have all Leaf paths that the OC mode has.

> This check does NOT check the type of the values returned.

Args:
 *  **xpaths**: List of /state gNMI paths to subscribe to.
     If the paths do not end in '/state', it will be appended.
     Paths can contain wildcard '*'.
 *  **model**: Python binding class to check the reply against.
 *  *check_missing_model_paths*: If True, it asserts that all OC Model Leaf
     paths are in the received Updates. Defaults to False.

### Module telemetry_sample

Uses gNMI Subscribe messages, of type STREAM, mode SAMPLE.

This test subscribes to a single gNMI xpath, request sampled streaming
telemetry and keep accumulating responses up to a timeout.
After the timeout, it checks that all returned paths have the same number of
updates, and that the time interval between updates is the requested value
(with a maximum drift tolerance).

E.g:
Suppose the test is subscribing to an xpath `/<root>/<container>`, with 15 secs
interval for 65 secs. The Target replies with Updates for several paths
(`/<root>/<container>/<leaf*>`). After collecting subscription responses for
65 secs, the test checks that all paths have 5 updates, and for each path,
that the timestamp difference of updates is 15 secs.

 Update path | Time
 ----------- | ----
 `/<root>/<container>/<leaf1>` | Update[t0] >> Update[t15] >> Update[t30] >> ...
 `/<root>/<container>/<leaf2>` | Update[t0] >> Update[t18] >> Update[t25] >> ...

> These checks do not validate the values returned on the updates.
> Use telemetry_once.* for that.

Args:
 *  **xpath**: gNMI path to subscribe to.
 *  **sample_interval**: Seconds interval between Updates
 *  **sample_timeout**: Seconds to keep the Subscription and collect Updates.
 *  *max_timestamp_drift_secs*: Maximum drift for the timestamp(s) in the
    reply. Defaults to 1 sec.

####  `telemetry_sample.CountUpdates`

In addition to the default checks of the module, this test checks the
Subscription to the xpath produces Updates for a determined number of paths.

E.g:
Suppose the test is subscribing to an xpath `/<root>/<container>`, with 15 secs
interval for 65 secs, expecting 3 Update paths. After collecting subscription
responses for 65 secs, the test checks that there are Updates for 3 xpaths.

Update path | t0 | t15 | t30 | t45 | t60
----------- | -- | --- | --- | --- | ---
`/<root>/<container>/<leaf1>` | value | value | value | value | value
`/<root>/<container>/<leaf2>` |       | value | value |       |
`/<root>/<container>/<leaf3>` | value |       | value |       | value

Args:
 * **update_paths_count**: Number of expected distinct Update paths.
